## About Me
Hi, I'm Jonathan!

This portfoilio aims to showcase my well-rounded skillset with tools such as Python, Tableau and R utilised across several projects. I follow a personal mantra of ‚Äúif a job is worth doing, it‚Äôs worth doing properly‚Äù and in my projects as a data analyst so far, I‚Äôve found it to fit perfectly with tasks like data cleaning and web-scraping. 

I want to grow as an analyst together with an organisation which enables its people to make a positive change for society by providing the data-driven insights needed to make confident and informed decisions.    

In my spare time I love to do/play/watch sports: backcountry skiing, bikepacking, golf, football, MMA are my main go-to's but I'll hapilly try anything. I've got a deep interest in history and enjoy documentaries or good books that tell the best stories!
