## About Me
Hi, I'm Jonathan!

I‚Äôm looking to build a sustainable career in data analytics. I follow a personal mantra of ‚Äúif a job is worth doing, it‚Äôs worth doing properly‚Äù and in my projects as a data analyst so far, I‚Äôve found it to fit perfectly with tasks like data cleaning and web-scraping. 
I can draw on my ability to build rapport and communicate from my career in education and coaching to tell impactful data stories. I love working in teams! Helping people achieve or going on a journey of improvement together brings out the best in me.

I want to grow as an analyst together with a company which enables its people to make a positive change on society by providing the data-driven insights needed to make confident and informed decisions.    

In my spare time I love to do/play/watch sports: backcountry skiing, bikepacking, golf, football, MMA are my main go-to's but I'll hapilly try anything. I've got a deep interest in history and enjoy documentaries or good books that tell the best stories!
